# Healthcare-Management-System

**Problem Statement:**
A hospital intends to streamline its operations by implementing a robust Patient Management System. This system aims to efficiently handle patient records, doctor appointments, treatment histories, and hospital performance metrics. Key functionalities include storing electronic health records (EHR), patient demographics, medical diagnoses, treatment histories, and doctor information. Additionally, it should facilitate in-depth analysis of patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics.

**Solution:**
The solution involves designing and implementing a relational database system to store patient and doctor information, medical records, and treatment details. Utilizing SQL queries, various analyses such as patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics will be performed to derive actionable insights.

**Database Schema:**
patients: Stores patient demographics.
doctors: Stores doctor information and specialization.
medical_records: Stores medical records, including admission dates, discharge dates, diagnoses, treatments, and associated doctor IDs.
